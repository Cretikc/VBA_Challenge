# VBA scripting
Purpose
    The purpose was to analyse the multiple stock workbook to summarize the quaterly stock performance across various tickers using VBA scripting.

How you did it?
     I use the VBA scripting, follow the instructions from lecture and modules and use virtual assitants. For initial work, I use code available in slack (from prof and Kim Nguyen) and use virtual assitant to work through it.
Conclusion
   The VBA scripting allow us to sumarize the large data sets of varied stocks across different tickers to analyse stock trends based on percent increment or decrement and total volume of each stocks. Such analysis (simplified by data analytics via VBA) provided insigths on future prediction on stock volatibility and risk.
